# Hello! Welcome to my Codecademy repository.
This is where I keep all my projects from a Codecademy data analysis class I began January 2021 and have continued working on throughout the school year.

I mainly began this course to continue **practicing my Python skills**, but I'm also thrilled that it has allowed me to create my own projects and expand my skills a great deal! I will keep this repository updated as I learn new things and improve my code.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
